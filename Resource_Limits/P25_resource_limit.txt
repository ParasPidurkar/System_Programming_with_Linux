what to learn 
-per-process resource limits
-types of resource limits
- distinguishing between soft and hard limits
- Details on how a user (or system administrator) can query and set the per-process resource limits using appropriate CLI frontends ( ulimit , prlimit )



A common hack is the (Distributed) denial-of-service ((D)DoS) attack. Here, the
malicious attacker attempts to consume, indeed overload, resources on the target
system to such an extent that the system either crashes, or at the very least, becomes
completely unresponsive (hung).


to fill the 1 GB of data with random content   bs is block size
dd if=/dev/urandom of=tst count=1024 bs=1M


ls -lh tst


The frontend command to view and set resource limits is a built-in shell command
(these commands are called bash-builtins): ulimit

To query the maximum possible
size of files written to by the shell process (and its children), we set the -f option
switch to ulimit :
$ ulimit -f
