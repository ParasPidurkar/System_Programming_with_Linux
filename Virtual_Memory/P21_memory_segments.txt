Stack segment

Every time a function is called, memory is allocated in the stack region (or segment or mapping) to hold metadata that has the function call,
 parameter passing and the function return mechanism work. This metadata region for each function is called the stack frame.

 If the processor is issued a push or pop instruction, it will go ahead and perform it.
But, think about it, how does the CPU know where exactly – at which stack memory location or address – it should push or pop memory? The answer: we reserve a
special CPU register, the stack pointer (usually abbreviated to SP), for precisely this purpose: the value in SP always points to the top of the stack
