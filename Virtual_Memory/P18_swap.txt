Swap is a filesystem type â€“ a raw disk partition is formatted as swap
upon system installation. It's treated as second-level RAM by the
OS. When the OS runs out of RAM, it uses swap. As a rough
heuristic, system administrators sometimes configure the size of the
swap partition to be twice that of available RAM.
