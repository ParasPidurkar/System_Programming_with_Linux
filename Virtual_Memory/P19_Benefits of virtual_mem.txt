Modern hardware-acceleration (via TLBs/CPU caches/prefetching)
mitigates this overhead and provides decent enough performance
The benefits one derives from VM outweigh the performance issues
On a VM-based system, we get the following benefits:
Process-isolation
The programmer need not worry about physical memory
Memory-region protection



With virtual memory OS-level support, the OS exposes APIs (the mmap(2) and
mprotect(2) system calls) with which one can change the default page
protections!


The OSes exception-handling routine determines whether the access is indeed illegal, and if so,
the OS immediately kills the process attempting this illegal access.
