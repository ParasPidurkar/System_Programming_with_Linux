segmentation and paging 
page frames -> primary mem
pages   ->     secondary memory

paging table maintains link of virtual page with physical page frames
PT working is totally dependent upon CPU/MMU.


###Indirection###

By introducing paging, we have actually introduced a level of indirection: we no
longer think of a (virtual) address as an absolute offset from zero, but rather as a
relative quantity: va = (page, offset) .
We think of each virtual address as associated with a page number and an offset from
the beginning of that page. This is called using one level of indirection.
So each time a process refers to a virtual address (and of course, note that this is
happening almost all of the time), the system must translate the virtual address to the
corresponding physical address based on the PTs for that process.

va = (page, offset)
va = virtual address

MMU does all the address translation 
va to pa and pa to va.
