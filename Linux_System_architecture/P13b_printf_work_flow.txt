The hello, world app (process) issues the printf(3) library call.
2. printf issues the write(2) system call.
3. The process invoking the system call now switches from User to Supervisor
(kernel) Mode.
4. The process runs the underlying kernel code, the underlying device driver
code, and thus, writes hello, world onto the monitor!
5. The process is then switched back to non-privileged User Mode.
